# Matrix
This is my implementation of a [mathematical matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_(mathematics)), written in C++. 
My goal is to provide an interface that can be used to 
create, manipulate, and perform calculations on matrices of arbitrary size.

# Motivation
Really, I just love math. I've been using a lot of matrices in my Differential Equations and Discrete Math classes,
and a lot of times my professors will bring up how "this can all just be done on a computer". So, I decided – why not make it on my own?

Are there better, more readily available implementations out there? Probably… but I love math and I love coding, so I'm doing it myself.

# Standards
- Made using C++17
- I tend to use `lowerCamelCase` for variables and functions, and `m_hungarianNaming` for data members – 
however, I believe formatting semantics come second to making readable code that's easy to use and understand.
  - Unless your name is Thien, and your sick, twisted mind uses `rEVERSEcAMELcASE`.

# IDE Used
Matrix was built using [JetBrains CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/), which itself uses [CMake](https://cmake.org/) to build and update the project.
